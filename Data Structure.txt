Data Structure is a data storage format. It is the collection of values and the format they are stored in, 
the relationships between the values in the collection as well as the operations applied on the data stored in the structure

Type of Data Structure:
    1. Array (in Python it is the same as list): good at accessing, reading values, bad at inserting and deleting 
        An array is a fixed-size collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations. 
        Elements can be accessed using their index position, making it efficient for random access but less flexible when it comes to resizing.
    2. Linked List :
        A linked list is a collection of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list. 
        Linked lists can be singly linked (one reference to the next node) or doubly linked (references to both the next and previous nodes). 
        They provide dynamic memory allocation and easier insertion and deletion of elements compared to arrays.
    3. Stack :
        A stack is a one-ended linear data structure(one end only) which models a real world stack by having two primary operations, namely push and pop.
        It follows the L-I-F-O(Last In First Out) principle. 
    4. Queue :
        A queue is a linear data structure which models real world queues by having two primary operations, namely enqueue and dequeue.
        It follows the F-I-F-O(First In First Out) principle.

Note: There are many data structures out there and everyday there will possibly be more new data structure. According to Chat GPT, the four above is the fundamental data structures.
